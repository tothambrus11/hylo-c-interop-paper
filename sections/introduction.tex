\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: C is lingua franca between languages, so one would expect it is suitable for it. No, it's horrible. Large historical baggage of ABI differences, type sizes, implementing interop solutions is always costly or not very portable. 
    
    
    $\rightarrow$ we analyze what are the options for handling this and what are the expected costs of different approaches.
    
    \item We analyzed the use cases of C/C++ interoperability (add condensed version of interop motivations), design a desirable roadmap for Hylo, a systems programming language (here describe what Hylo is, and what are its characteristics).
    
    \item C interoperability tools are often very limited in capabilities, which makes them a usability nightmare, leading to inconsistencies bugs, and security issues.
    $\rightarrow$ Swift achieved seamless cross-language interop, analyze the magic behind it
    \item Little consideration of the practical and technical aspects in academic research
    

    \item State the research questions again, clearly, briefly
    \item
