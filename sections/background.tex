This section provides a brief overview of the categories of academic literature related to this topic.

Categories include case studies, semantic theoretical analysis, interop technology design, large-scale interop usage analysis, ... - cite all relevant papers here (~30) and the most relevant ones (~3-5).

Highlight that most research is focused within the industry, largely in Apple (around Swift), recently in Google (Carbon, AutoCXX, Crubit), and Adobe (Zngur) - see how much is appropriate to disclose here - the point is, companies are having a lot of trouble adopting Rust in large code bases, and the industry is looking for solutions. Academia should also be looking, it's a large topic to explore.
