    \end{itemize}
    \item Feedback from Hylo contributor meetings (David Abrahams, Dimitri Racordon, Lucian Radu Teodorescu)
    \item Literature review using snowballing, elicit, Undermind
    \item Prototype using LibClang (interop with C API from Swift)
    \item Creating the integer conversion constructs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Responsible Research}
Use of AI: when extensive deep research reports are created, the prompt, the AI model, the model's methodology, and the output are recorded, along with the original sources.
