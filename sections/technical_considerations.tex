\section{Technical Considerations and Architecture of C Interoperability Technology in Hylo}

















\subsection{Transparent Cross-Language IDE Features}
Draft: In statically compiled languages, so far Swift's solution is by far the best. They created SourceKit-LSP (language server protocol) that provides a rich set of features like code completion, symbol renaming, cross-language navigation, and debugging. It is built on top of the ClangD (the C/C++ language server) and SourceKitD, Swift's language server. SourceKit-LSP is a part of the Swift toolchain, and it is used by Xcode, VSCode, and other editors. TODO describe how this works, what's the architecture, and whether it needs modifications to clangd or we can just use and wrap it in Hylo-LSP.

Include nice architecture diagram.
