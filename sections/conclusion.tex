\section{Conclusions}

For a new systems programming language like Hylo, effective C interoperability is a critical catalyst for adoption and growth. In this paper, we presented a principled design for a high-fidelity interoperability layer that balances safety, performance, and usability. We identified the core technical challenges—from ABI portability to the ambiguity of C idioms—and proposed a robust architecture to address them. This architecture is founded on leveraging the power of Clang to ensure correctness and is defined by a comprehensive semantic mapping that provides sensible defaults while empowering developers with the flexibility to create truly idiomatic bindings. Through this work, we have provided not only a clear implementation path for Hylo but also a valuable reference for other language designers navigating the complex but essential task of bridging worlds with C.
