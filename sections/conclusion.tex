Effective C interoperability is critical for the success of a new systems language like Hylo. This paper provides a principled and practical design for a high-fidelity interoperability layer that balances safety, usability, and performance. By leveraging Clang for correctness and providing a flexible semantic mapping framework, our work offers a clear implementation roadmap for Hylo. It also serves as a reference for other language designers facing the essential task of bridging new languages with the existing C ecosystem.
