  abstract  = {The automatic translation of legacy C code to Rust presents significant challenges, particularly in handling preprocessor macros.   C macros introduce metaprogramming constructs that operate at the text level, outside of C's syntax tree, making their direct translation to Rust non-trivial.   Existing transpilers --- source-to-source compilers --- expand macros before translation, sacrificing their abstraction and reducing code maintainability.   In this work, we introduce Oxidize, a macro-aware C-to-Rust transpilation framework that preserves macro semantics by translating C macros into Rust-compatible constructs while selectively expanding only those that interfere with Rust's stricter semantics.  We evaluate our techniques on a small-scale study of real-world macros and find that the majority can be safely and idiomatically transpiled without full expansion.},

  abstract  = {For decades, the C programming language proved to be a cornerstone of system-software ecosystems, leaving us with billion lines of existing source code. From today's perspective of object-oriented and functional languages, C itself seems rather limited in its expressiveness and abstractive power. However, with the C preprocessor (CPP) as its companion, macros, which operate on the raw token stream, allow for abstractions that are impossible to achieve within the language itself. While its flexibility and its ease of use make CPP attractive for programmers, its potential undisciplined usage makes it problematic for static source-code analysis and can slow down the on-boarding of new developers.In this paper, we focus on a disciplined subclass of CPP macros: the statement-like and expression-like macros, which mimic regular C functions, with well-type C expressions as arguments and, in case, a return value. We show how to spot such macros and their arguments in the compiler's abstract syntax tree, whereby it becomes possible to deduct type signatures for individual macro expansions. With our CppSig prototype, implemented as a Clang plugin, we extract macro-type information from Linux 5.12, whereby it becomes easier to understand even deep macro-expansion nests. In the future, these expansion signatures could be used to statically enforce gradually-typed CPP macro definitions.},
