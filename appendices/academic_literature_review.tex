\subsection{General Interoperability Research from Last 10 years (2015-2025)}
Interoperability tools have vastly changed and developed in the last 10 years since the introduction of Swift in 2014 and Rust getting popular for the C and C++ community. We limited the general research to the last 10 years to make reviewing abstracts more feasible.

\subsection{C Specific Research}

\texttt{( "c" W/2 interoperability ) AND NOT "LLM" AND NOT "artificial intelligence" AND NOT "Large Language model" AND NOT "C-ITS"

\subsection{C++ Specific Research}

\texttt{( "c++" W/2 interoperability ) AND NOT "LLM" AND NOT "artificial intelligence" AND NOT "Large Language model" AND NOT "C-ITS"
}

\subsection{General Review with Undermind AI}

TODO redo this again with different query

Full search query: \textit{I want to find a comprehensive collection and analysis of the desirable properties and evaluation criteria for native interoperability technologies between Hylo (as a prospective C++ successor) and C and C++, with a focus on overcoming the greatest challenges in such interop (e.g., code generation for difficult C constructs, macros, ABI compatibility, generics/templates, exceptions, idiomatic stdlib features, asynchrony, build/tooling ecosystem integration, incremental and unordered adoption). The review must include direct/native interop technologies (including Clang-based and other safety-improving FFI approaches, but not IDL/IPC), with concrete examples and architectural mechanisms that address the outlined challenges, emphasizing how they enable practical, safe, and incremental migration or coexistence between C++ and the new language}
